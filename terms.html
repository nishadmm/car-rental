              <p>
                OnWheel Renting. (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”)
                shall rent out a vehicle (hereinafter referred to as “Rental
                Car”) to the Renter, and the Renter shall rent the Rental Car
                from the Company, all in accordance with the provisions in this
                Agreement. Matters not provided for in this Agreement shall be
                governed by relevant laws and regulations, and common practice.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Company may make special provisions as long as they do not
                violate the purport of this Agreement, laws and regulations,
                administrative issuances, and common practice. If a special
                provision is made, such provision shall take precedence over
                this Agreement.

              <h3>Making a Reservation</h3>
              <p>
                Having consented to this Agreement, the separately prescribed
                price list, and other terms and conditions, the Renter may make
                a reservation, in accordance with the method separately provided
                by the Company, clearly specifying in advance the model or
                vehicle class, rental start date and time, rental location,
                rental period, return location, the name of the driver, requests
                for accessories such as toddler seats, and any other rental
                conditions (hereinafter referred to as “Rental Conditions”).
              </p>

              <p>
                When the Renter has made a reservation, the Company shall offer
                the Rental Cars for rent in its possession. Upon reservation,
                the Company may request payment of a separately prescribed
                reservation fee, and the Renter shall pay the fee accordingly.

              <h3>Changes to Reservations</h3>
              <p>
                The Renter must obtain the consent of the Company prior to the
                rental start date and time for any changes to the Rental
                Conditions provided for in paragraph 1 of the preceding Article.

              <h3>Reservation Cancellations, etc.</h3>
              <p>
                The Renter may cancel a reservation by obtaining the consent of
                the Company.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the Renter has failed to pay the reservation fee , Paragraph
                2, by the deadline specified by the Company, then the Company
                may cancel the reservation.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a reservation has been cancelled by virtue of the preceding
                two paragraphs, the Renter shall pay the Company the reservation
                cancellation fee prescribed separately by the Company. If the
                reservation cancellation fee has been paid when a reservation
                fee had been paid, the Company shall reimburse the Renter the
                reservation fee.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Company shall promptly inform the Renter when it is not
                possible to rent out the Rental Car reserved due to reasons
                attributable to the Company. In such a case, when it is not
                possible to rent out a different Rental Car of the same model or
                vehicle class (hereinafter referred to as “Substitute Rental
                Car”), or when the Renter does not agree to rent a Substitute
                Rental Car, the reservation shall be cancelled, and the Company
                shall reimburse the Renter the reservation fee.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Company shall promptly notify the Renter according to the
                method it determined in advance when it is not possible to rent
                out a Rental Car reserved by the Renter due to natural
                disasters, accidents, theft, vehicle malfunctions or defects,
                recalls, delayed return by other renters, malfunctions in
                telecommunications operations, such as landline phones, mobile
                phones, smartphones, or internet connections, malfunctions or
                bugs in the system used to run the Company's Rental Car
                operations, or other reasons that cannot be attributed to the
                Company, or when it objectively deems inappropriate to rent out
                a vehicle to the Renter. In such a case, when it is not possible
                to rent out a Substitute Rental Car, or when the Renter does not
                agree to rent a Substitute Rental Car, the reservation shall be
                deemed to have been canceled. If a reservation has been
                canceled, the Company shall reimburse the Renter the reservation
                fee received, and the Company shall not be liable for any damage
                incurred by the Renter due to the cancellation of such
                reservation.
              </p>

              <p>
                If the Renter has agreed to rent a Substitute Rental Car in the
                cases mentioned in the preceding two paragraphs, the Company
                shall rent out a Substitute Rental Car under the same Rental
                Conditions set at the time of reservation, except for the model
                or vehicle class; provided, however, that when the rental fee
                for the Substitute Rental Car is lower than that of the model or
                vehicle class reserved, the rental fee for the model or vehicle
                class of the Substitute Rental Car shall apply.

              <h3>Lack of an Agreement</h3>
              <p>
                The Company and the Renter shall apply or handle matters in
                accordance with the provisions of the preceding article in the
                event that there is no agreement, including cancellation of
                reservations or failure to conclude a rental agreement./p>
              </p>

              <p>
                In the event that, during the rental period, the Renter or the
                Driver uses a toll road, hourly parking, or other services
                provided by another company, the Renter or the Driver shall be
                responsible for settlement of the usage charges or other charges
                incurred from such use.

              <h3>Cancellation of the Rental Agreement</h3>
              <p>
                If the Company already has received any rental fees, then it
                shall refund to the Renter the balance thereof remaining after
                deducting the rental fees corresponding to the period from the
                actual handing over of the Rental Car to the Renter to the
                release of the Rental Agreement.
              </p>

              <p>
                If the Renter has caused any damage to the Company then the
                Company shall demand from the Renter compensation for such
                damage.

              <h3>Cancellation Due to Rental Car Defects</h3>
              <p>
                The Renter may cancel the Rental Agreement when the Rental Car
                cannot be used due to defects that existed prior to rental by
                the Renter.
